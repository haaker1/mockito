# Report for assignment 3

## Project

Name: Anne Haaker, Alex Gunnarsson, Hugo Tricot, Juan Bautista Lavagnini Portela

URL: https://github.com/haaker1/mockito 

The project is mockito, which is a tool used for mock-testing Java projects.

## Onboarding experience

The could be built and run as documented in the project README. To build the project, JDK had to be upgraded to JDK 17 which was easily done from the JDK documentation. In addition, gradle had to be installed, but it was installed automatically when running the build script. The build concluded without errors, but there were some warnings such as "OpenJDK 64-bit Server VM warning: Sharing is only supported for boot loader classes because bootstrap classpath has been appended". However, this did not seem to affect the build since it concluded successfully. All the tests passed on our systems.

## Complexity



1. What are your results for five complex functions?
   * Did all methods (tools vs. manual count) get the same result?
   * Are the results clear?
2. Are the functions just complex, or also long?
3. What is the purpose of the functions?
4. Are exceptions taken into account in the given measurements?
5. Is the documentation clear w.r.t. all the possible outcomes?

## Refactoring

Plan for refactoring complex code:

Estimated impact of refactoring (lower CC, but other drawbacks?).

Carried out refactoring (optional, P+):

git diff ...

## Coverage

### Tools

Document your experience in using a "new"/different coverage tool.

How well was the tool documented? Was it possible/easy/difficult to
integrate it with your build environment?

### Your own coverage tool

Show a patch (or link to a branch) that shows the instrumented code to
gather coverage measurements.

The patch is probably too long to be copied here, so please add
the git command that is used to obtain the patch instead:

git diff ...

What kinds of constructs does your tool support, and how accurate is
its output?

### Evaluation

1. How detailed is your coverage measurement?

2. What are the limitations of your own tool?

3. Are the results of your tool consistent with existing coverage tools?

## Coverage improvement

Show the comments that describe the requirements for the coverage.

Report of old coverage: [link]

Report of new coverage: [link]

Test cases added:

git diff ...

Number of test cases added: two per team member (P) or at least four (P+).
